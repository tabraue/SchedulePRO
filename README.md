SchedulePro is a powerful web application designed to streamline and simplify employee scheduling and shift management for businesses. With a focus on visual representation and intuitive features, SchedulePro is the ultimate solution for efficient schedule management.

## Features

- **Department and Employee Management**: SchedulePro allows businesses to create and manage multiple departments and their respective employees. Managers can easily add, remove, and update employee information within the system.

- **Intuitive Shift Scheduling**: Our platform offers a visually intuitive interface for assigning shifts to employees. Managers can assign colors to different shifts, making it easy to identify and differentiate between morning, afternoon, and evening shifts, for example.

- **Email Notifications**: In the initial version of SchedulePro, managers have the ability to send weekly or monthly shift schedules directly to employees via email. This feature ensures that everyone is kept informed and up-to-date with their assigned shifts.

- **Future Enhancements**: We are constantly working on adding more features to SchedulePro to meet the evolving needs of businesses. Planned enhancements include vacation and medical leave management, an internal chat system for seamless communication among team members, and even a time-clock functionality for accurate time tracking.
